For example, a child born into a wealthy family has access to better nutrition, schools, connections, etc. which translates into better jobs and even more wealth later on. Conversely, a child born into poverty often lacks access to resources and opportunities, making it difficult to escape poverty.\n\nOver time, small differences in initial resources, opportunities, status, etc. can amplify into wide disparities. The sociologists Robert Merton and Harriet Zuckerman introduced the \"Matthew effect\" term into the sociological discourse in 1968 to describe such cumulative advantage and disadvantage processes. It continues to be an active area of study across the social sciences."

Here's an example of Go code for a simple data analysis:\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n    \"fmt\"\n    \"math\"\n)\n\nfunc main() {\n    // Sample data\n    data := []float64{10.5, 8.2, 12.3, 9.7, 11.1, 7.9, 13.6, 10.2, 9.4, 11.8}\n\n    // Calculate the sum of the data\n    sum := 0.0\n    for _, value := range data {\n        sum += value\n    }\n\n    // Calculate the mean\n    mean := sum / float64(len(data))\n\n    // Calculate the variance and standard deviation\n    variance := 0.0\n    for _, value := range data {\n        variance += math.Pow(value-mean, 2)\n    }\n    variance /= float64(len(data))\n    stddev := math.Sqrt(variance)\n\n    // Find the minimum and maximum values\n    min := data[0]\n    max := data[0]\n    for _, value := range data {\n        if value < min {\n            min = value\n        }\n        if value > max {\n            max = value\n        }\n    }\n\n    // Print the results\n    fmt.Printf(\"Data: %v\\n\", data)\n    fmt.Printf(\"Sum: %.2f\\n\", sum)\n    fmt.Printf(\"Mean: %.2f\\n\", mean)\n    fmt.Printf(\"Variance: %.2f\\n\", variance)\n    fmt.Printf(\"Standard Deviation: %.2f\\n\", stddev)\n    fmt.Printf(\"Minimum: %.2f\\n\", min)\n    fmt.Printf(\"Maximum: %.2f\\n\", max)\n}\n```\n\nIn this code:\n\n1. We define a slice of `float64` values called `data` to represent our sample data.\n\n2. We calculate the sum of the data by iterating over the `data` slice and adding each value to the `sum` variable.\n\n3. We calculate the mean by dividing the sum by the number of data points.\n\n4. We calculate the variance by iterating over the `data` slice again, subtracting the mean from each value, squaring the difference, and adding it to the `variance` variable. We then divide the variance by the number of data points.\n\n5. We calculate the standard deviation by taking the square root of the variance.\n\n6. We find the minimum and maximum values by iterating over the `data` slice and updating the `min` and `max` variables accordingly.\n\n7. Finally, we print the results, including the original data, sum, mean, variance, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum values.\n\nWhen you run this code, it will output the following:\n\n```\nData: [10.5 8.2 12.3 9.7 11.1 7.9 13.6 10.2 9.4 11.8]\nSum: 104.70\nMean: 10.47\nVariance: 2.93\nStandard Deviation: 1.71\nMinimum: 7.90\nMaximum: 13.60\n```\n\nThis code provides a basic example of performing simple data analysis tasks in Go, such as calculating the sum, mean, variance, standard deviation, and finding the minimum and maximum values in a dataset."

You can customize this function based on your specific transformation requirements.\n",
            "\n",

It uses the `sqlalchemy` library to establish a connection to the database and the `to_sql` method from pandas to load the data into a specified table. You need to provide the database connection URL and the table name.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. Main: The `main` function orchestrates the entire workflow. It calls the `extract_data` function to extract the data from the source, passes the extracted data to the `transform_data` function for transformations, and finally calls the `load_data` function to load the transformed data into the target system.\n",

            "- `'path/to/your/data.csv'`: Replace with the actual file path of your CSV data.\n",
            "- `'postgresql://username:password@host:port/database'`: Replace with your database connection URL.\n",
